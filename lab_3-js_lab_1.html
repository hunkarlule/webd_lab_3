# Create a function for each question (Total 10) in one
JavaScript file. You have to submit your js file with 
10 functions by the end of the class.

Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting 
them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" 
returns "HiByeByeHi".

(Test Cases)
makeAbba("Hi", "Bye") → "HiByeByeHi"
makeAbba("Yo", "Alice") → "YoAliceAliceYo"
makeAbba("What", "Up") → "WhatUpUpWhat"


Given a string, return true if it ends in "ly".

    (Test Cases)
    endsLy("oddly") → true
    endsLy("y") → false
    endsLy("oddy") → false


Given a string of even length, return the first half. 
So the string "WooHoo" yields "Woo".

    (Test Cases)
    firstHalf("WooHoo") → "Woo"
    firstHalf("HelloThere") → "Hello"
    firstHalf("abcdef") → "abc"


Given a string, return a "rotated right 2" version where 
the last 2 chars are moved to the start. The string 
length will be at least 2.

(Test Cases)
right2("Hello") → "loHel"
right2("java") → "vaja"
right2("Hi") → "Hi"


Given two strings, append them together (known as
"concatenation") and return the result. However, 
if the concatenation creates a double-char, then omit 
one of the chars, so "abc" and "cat" yields "abcat".

(Test Cases)
conCat("abc", "cat") → "abcat"
conCat("dog", "cat") → "dogcat"
conCat("abc", "") → "abc"


Given a string, return true if the first 2 chars in the string
also appear at the end of the string, such as with "edited".

(Test Cases)
frontAgain("edited") → true
frontAgain("edit") → false
frontAgain("ed") → true



Given a string, return a version without the first 
2 chars. Except keep the first char if it is 'a' 
and keep the second char if it is 'b'. The string 
may be any length. Harder than it looks.

     (Test Cases)
deFront("Hello") → "llo"
deFront("java") → "va"
deFront("away") → "aay"

	

Given a string, if one or both of the first 2 chars is 'x',
return the string without those 'x' chars, and otherwise
return the string unchanged. This is a little harder than 
it looks.

     (Test Cases)
     withoutX2("xHi") → "Hi"
     withoutX2("Hxi") → "Hi"
     withoutX2("Hi") → "Hi"



Given 2 strings, a and b, return a new string made of the
first char of a and the last char of b, so "yo" and "java"
yields "ya". If either string is length 0, use '@' for 
its missing char.

(Test Cases)
lastChars("last", "chars") → "ls"
lastChars("yo", "java") → "ya"
lastChars("hi", "") → "h@"


Given a string of even length, return a string made of the
middle two chars, so the string "string" yields "ri". 
The string length will be at least 2.

(Test Cases)
middleTwo("string") → "ri"
middleTwo("code") → "od"
middleTwo("Practice") → "ct"
